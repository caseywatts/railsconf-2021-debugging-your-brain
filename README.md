# Debugging Your Brain, RailsConf 2021

## Description

## Prereqs
Before the session, come up with **three topics** that are on your mind lately that you would **like to discuss** in the pair braeakouts. 
 * Examples: an argument at work, a sour conversation with your family, stressed about the world/news, feeling isolated over the past year

### What kind of topics?
 * Consider topics you find yourself **ruminating** on: thinking about a lot, accidentally focusing on the negative parts and how stressful they are instead of more helpful and productive thoughts.
 * Consider  topics that, when they come up, they cause you to have a **downward spiral** of negative thoughts leading to negative feelings leading to more negative thoughts, etc.

### Brainstorming Prompts
 * To help you brainstorm, some contexts:
    * Work, Home, Play, School, Social, News, Hobby, Health
 * To help you brainstorm, some stressor types:
   * burnout, a recurring problem, a trigger/prompt, a mistake, conflict, a pet peeve, a pain, a systemic problem
 * To help you brainstorm, some questions:
    * What has been on your mind a lot lately?
    * What's something you have been talking about or reading about a lot lately?
    * Ask a friend - "What is something you have noticed that is bothering me lately?"
