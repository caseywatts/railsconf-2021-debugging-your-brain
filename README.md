# Debugging Your Brain, RailsConf 2021

## Description

How to Debug Your Brain:
1. Notice a bug
2. Set a breakpoint
3. Investigate the inputs
4. Read the code until you truly understand it
5. Write tests for it
6. Refactor it / edit it to fix the bug

These map to some big ideas we will cover in the workshop
1. "Uh oh, a downward spiral / rumination!"
2. Whoop! => Mindful Introspection
3. The Four Inputs
4. Processing Experiences = thinking, talking, writing, reading
5. Validation = "it makes sense that..."
6. Cognitive Restructuring = countering cognitive distortions

## Structure
You will get to talk about real issues on your mind with people who are ready to actively listen.

Casey's hands-on workshop format is inspired by his experience teaching software development, dance, and music. Casey balances presentation with hands-on activities, alternating between them. Right before each activity, Casey shares the principles clearly and shares just enough story to make them memorable. Workshop attendees then apply the skills to their own problems in small randomly-assigned breakout groups. For some topics we will use the meetingâ€™s sidebar chat for discussion.


## pre-work - brainstorm topics
Before the session, come up with **three topics** that are on your mind lately that you would **like to discuss** in the pair braeakouts. 

Examples:
* an argument at work
* a sour conversation with your family
* stressed about the world/news
* feeling isolated over the past year

What kind of topics?
 * Consider topics you find yourself **ruminating** on: thinking about a lot, accidentally focusing on the negative parts and how stressful they are instead of more helpful and productive thoughts.
 * Consider topics that, when they come up, cause you to have a **downward spiral** of negative thoughts leading to negative feelings leading to more negative thoughts, etc.

Brainstorming Prompts
 * To help you brainstorm, some contexts:
    * Work, Home, Play, School, Social, News, Hobby, Health
 * To help you brainstorm, some stressor types:
   * burnout, a recurring problem, a trigger/prompt, a mistake, conflict, a pet peeve, a pain, a systemic problem
 * To help you brainstorm, some questions:
    * What has been on your mind a lot lately?
    * What's something you have been talking about or reading about a lot lately?
    * Ask a friend - "What is something you have noticed that is bothering me lately?"
